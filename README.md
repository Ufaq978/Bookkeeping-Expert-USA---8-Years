# Bookkeeping-Expert-USA---8-Years

**Specializes in Bookkeeping**

Hello! My name is Ufaq, but you can call me Evelyn. I really enjoy bookkeeping because I love working with numbers. It makes me happy. I have an MBA in Accounting & Finance and have been doing bookkeeping for clients for more than 8 years. Also, I know QuickBooks Online really well because I'm a certified expert. I've worked a lot with other tools too, like Gusto, PayPal, Stripe, Square, Bill.com, Dext, Google Sheets, and Excel.

ðŸš€ If you own a small business in the service or trade industry and find it difficult to balance bookkeeping, business growth, and personal time, you are not alone. It can be difficult to manage your finances effectively and still find time for yourself. That's where I come in: I offer specialized bookkeeping services that take the financial management load off your shoulders.

Here are some really good reasons to pick me for bookkeeping:

âœ… I'm a trusted bookkeeper. People say I'm really good at keeping things neat and working well together.

âœ… I'm great with computers; I know how to use QuickBooks, Xero, and other tools too, like Gusto, PayPal, Stripe, Square, Bill.com, Dext, Google Sheets, and Excel.

âœ… I do it all: I can take care of accounts payables, account receivables, accounting stuff for the business, and paychecks for workers.

âœ… Setting things up: I'm adept at getting accounting software setup, making sure all transactions are recorded, and creating financial reports that tell you how the business is doing.

âœ… I mix well with other tools: I use Trello, ClickUp, and Asana to make sure everything works together smoothly.

âœ… Cleaning up a mess: If your accounting books are in a mess, I can sort them out so they are all nice and current.

âœ… Keeping secrets: Always make sure no one else sees your confident material.

These are some things I'm really good at:

âœ…Properly categorizing transactions

âœ…Maintaining clean financials

âœ…Monthly bank reconciliations

âœ…Preparing monthly reports, including the P&L and the Balance sheet

âœ…Accounts Payable & Accounts Receivable
